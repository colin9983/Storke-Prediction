# Storke-Prediction(Imbalanced Dataset)


This is a stroke prediction case which aims to predict stroke by using the simplest of basic physical health values.
This data source is an extreme labelling imbalance, and SMOTE was used in the process to improve the accuracy of the prediction.
The imbalance problem was solved and the final prediction accuracy was 96%.
